# LRCv2
Open for contribution. ID3 standardized SYNCEDLYRICS but not .lrc.make it standard.

1. Will need a WYSIWYG editor if using every feature.
2. File Extension - .lrc, .music, or add it to metadata.
3. Purpose - lyrics, kareoke with time and pitch, Chords, meaning, translation.

### Automation
All features for creating .lrc can be automated 

1. Get Lyrics from Internet sources like Genius or Speech-to-Text/Speech Recognition (https://github.com/openai/whisper).
2. Synced Lyrics can be retrived or time lyrics using https://github.com/oseiskar/autosubsync.
3. Chords can be automated (using software like Riffstation) or retrived from database like ultimateguitar.
4. Vocal Melody can be Isolate automatedlly using (See below) and covert it to MIDI using (See Below).
5. Translation can be retrived from Musixmatch or Google Translate or Offline using https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate.
6. Meaning can be retrived from Genius or LLM like ollama LLM models.

## Player to read filename with type speficied

If a audio file is played and there is a .lrc in the same directory or it is specefied in player the .lrc can be named -
```
sameasaudiofilename.lrc              -
sameasaudiofilename_translation.lrc  -  for seperate translation lrc
sameasaudiofilename_meaning.lrc      -  for seperate meaning lrc
sameasaudiofilename.chordpro         -  for chordpro
```
Or Metadata fields -
```
SYNCEDLYRICS         - Lyrics
LYRICS_translation   - Translation
LYRICS_meaning       - Meaning
Chordpro             - For Chords in Chordpro format
```
1 file can have all 3 meaning, translation, chords. Keep in mind ChordPro has metadata like `{title: You Are My Sunshine}` but lrc uses `[ti:Let's Twist Again]` and sections like `{c:Verse 1}` but I recommend `[c:Verse 1]`

## 1.1 Metadata - .lrc version info

Format 

```
[lrc version:2]
```
## 1.2 Metadata - Language   

like `[ar:Lyrics artist]`

### 3.3 Contexual Language Translation - per Word/Phrase

specify translation lanuages for German to English like `de>en`
file can have multiple translations

Dictionary in the player may not be useful as word can be contexual and as used in gerneral/other cases.

### Format

```
[00:00.00] [WordMeanind,de>en]Überheblich[/WordMeanind:Arrogant], [WordMeanind]überlegen[/WordMeanind:consider]
```

## 4. Suggested UI for Translation and Meaning Feature

![ui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105455604/168247326-d772633e-c073-4928-9400-ada37fa4817d.png)

When meaning mode from the top button is selected hovering over will show line, phrase or paragraph hilighted depening on context (when explaing song lyrics only one line or paragraph is sufficient) 

When translation mode is selected hovering over will hilight phrases (as small as possible) giving meaning of the phrase and words used trageted for langauge learning.

## 5. Custom Text Color (for expression)

### Format

```
[02:16.00] [cr=#dc143c]Destroy yourself, see who gives a[/cr] [cr=#420612]duck[/cr]
[02:18.00] See who gives a duck
```
## 6. Custom Text Size (for expression)

This can be turned off when using slidding lyrics depending of screen types. For example on phone with scrooling lyrics size can be hard to do.

### Format

```
[02:16.00] [sz=10]Destroy yourself, see who gives a[/sz] [sz=20]duck[/sz]
[02:18.00] See who gives a duck
```
## 7. Censoring Words
